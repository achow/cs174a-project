PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
 
Main Idea:
    We will be creating a 3D Pac Man game.

Description:
    The game will be from the perspective of Pac Man. We are planning on making this a first person game (i.e. from Pac Man’s view).
	We will use the keyboard to control Pac Man’s movements.
	The maze will be a 3D version of a one-story-high maze. All characters, objects (including points) will be in 3D. This will be the main view. When changing directions, the camera will turn smoothly to the new direction.
    There will be 2D map of the maze (top-down view) in a corner of the screen. This will be modeled after a normal Pac Man game (i.e. the character will move like so).

Advanced Topics:
	1. Color Picking
		Selecting the maze and actors will change them into red.
		
	2. Collisions
		All objects will interact (including the game world, i.e. the maze) when they collide. Pacman eats the pellets and dies when it collides with the monsters when they completely collide.
